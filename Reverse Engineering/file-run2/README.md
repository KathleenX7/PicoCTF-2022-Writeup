# file-run2

## Author

## Description

Another program, but this time, it seems to want some input. What happens if you try to run it on the command line with input "Hello!"?
Download the program [here](./run).

## Hints

1. Try running it and add the phrase "Hello!" with a space in front (i.e. "./run Hello!")

## Approach

I searched for pico in the file and found `picoCTF{F1r57_4rgum3n7_981abfb5}` which worked as the flag

## Flag

picoCTF{F1r57_4rgum3n7_981abfb5}
