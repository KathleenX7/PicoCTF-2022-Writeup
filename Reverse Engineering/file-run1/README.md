## Description

A program has been provided to you, what happens if you try to run it on the command line?
Download the program [here](./run).

## Hints

1. To run the program at all, you must make it executable (i.e. $ chmod +x run)
2. Try running it by adding a '.' in front of the path to the file (i.e. $ ./run)

## Approach

I searched for pico in the file and found `picoCTF{U51N6_Y0Ur_F1r57_F113_5578e314}` which worked as the flag

## Flag

picoCTF{U51N6_Y0Ur_F1r57_F113_5578e314}
