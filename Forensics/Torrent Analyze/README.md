# Torrent Analyze

## Description
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`. [Captured traffic](./torrent.pcap).
## Hints
1. Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols
3. Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. [Article](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html)
4. The file name ends with `.iso`
## Approach
Following hints 1 and 2 is good. After that, I started searching for "iso" in the strings. That didn't work well so I had to switch strategies. All files have a [unique hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification) (or [should have a unique hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision)) so my next attempt was to search "hash":

I found 4 different hashes:
```
e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e
7af6be54c2ed4dcb8d17bf599516b97bb66c0bfd
17c0c2c3b7825ba4fbe2f8c8055e000421def12c
17c02f9957ea8604bc5a04ad3b56766a092b5556
```
I tried searching up each hash, the last 3 had nothing come up. Searching 'e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e ".iso"' got [this website](https://linuxtracker.org/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e) for torrenting the `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso` file.
## Flag
picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}
