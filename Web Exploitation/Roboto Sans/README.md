## Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.  
Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:65442) out.
## Hints
(None)
## Approach
"Roboto Sans" alludes to robots which reminded me of the [robots exclusion standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard). I visited the website's [`robots.txt` file](http://saturn.picoctf.net:65442/robots.txt):
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```
This was a bit different from a traditional robots question since the disallows were not acutually the flags. Onr thing to notice is there's a line of base64: "anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==". We can user an [online deocder](https://www.base64decode.org/) and get "js/myfile.txt". Visiting [js/myfile.txt](http://saturn.picoctf.net:65442/js/myfile.txt) yields the flag.
