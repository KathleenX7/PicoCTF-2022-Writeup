# Secrets
## Author

## Description
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?  
The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54925).
## Hints
1. folders folders folders
## Approach
If you inspect the page, you'll notice in the head, the CSS is linked. For whatever reason, the CSS is put into a folder called "secret". That's suspicious.
```html
<link href="secret/assets/index.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
If we visit [`/secret`](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54925/secret/) we'll notice a file inside a folder called "hudden" when looking at the HTML:
```html
<head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="hidden/file.css">
</head>
```
At [`/secret/hidden`](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54925/secret/hidden/) we will once again find a file that's linked:
```html
<link href="superhidden/login.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
Finally at [`/secret/hidden/superhidden`](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54925/secret/hidden/superhidden/) we find
```html
<body>
    <h1>Finally. You found me. But can you see me</h1>
    <h3 class="flag">picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_34327aaf}</h3>
</body>
```
## Flag
