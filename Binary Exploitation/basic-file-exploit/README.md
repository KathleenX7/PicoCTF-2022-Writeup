# basic-file-exploit

## Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:
`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50366`
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](./program-redacted.c)

## Hints

1. Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. Like a string instead of a number.

## Approach

Putting `nc saturn.picoctf.net 50366` in the terminal, I get the following options:

* Type '1' to enter a phrase into our database
* Type '2' to echo a phrase in our database
* Type '3' to exit the program

Just to text out the program, I did the following:
```

picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_25D6CDDB}
```

I tried the flag at the end and it worked.
