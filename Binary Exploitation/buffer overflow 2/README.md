## Description
Control the return address and arguments  
This time you'll need to control the arguments to the function you return to! Can you get the flag from this [program](./vuln)? You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 51561`
## Hints
1. Try using GDB to print out the stack once you write to it.
## Approach
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/eJ0FmCfD-1g) and change a few things to fit the current problem.
## Flag
