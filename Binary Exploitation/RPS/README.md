## Description

Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row.
Connect to the program with netcat:
`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52524`
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](./game-redacted.c).

## Hints

1. How does the program check if you won?

## Approach

Running the code, it gives: 
```
Welcome challenger to the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
For anyone that beats me 5 times in a row, I will offer up a flag I found
Are you ready?
Type '1' to play a game
Type '2' to exit the program
```

Looking at the code, what compares your move and the computers move is the following:

```c++
if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
} else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
}
```

strstr(String a, String b) checks if the String b is in String a. To ensure that we win every time, we can input "rockpaperscissors". Doing this 5 times, we get the flag
