# buffer overflow 3
## Author
Sanjay C / Palash Oswal
## Description
Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? It looks like Dr. Oswal added a stack canary to this [program](./vuln) to protect against buffer overflows. You can view source [here](./vuln.c). And connect with it using:  
`nc saturn.picoctf.net 63257`
## Hints
1. Maybe there's a smart way to brute-force the canary?
## Approach
I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/4Eir5gsSIM8) and changed parts of the code (assuming pwntools updated).
### script.py
For [`script.py`](./script.py), the goal is to brute force the canary. We do this by just looping through a bunch of characters and spamming it on the shell. Each time a correct character is found, the program will print it then terminate. At each correct character, modify line 4 to be one number higher and append the right character to line 5.
### exploit.py
Looking at [`vuln.c`](./vuln.c) tells us the canary is 4 characters long meaning we can stop running [`script.py`](./script.py) once we get 4 characters. We find the canary is "BiRd". When we get to 4 characters, we know the canary and can overflow the buffer. If we run `gdb vuln` and then `disassemble win` we can find the address of the win function. After that, we can build the [exploit script](./exploit.py) and run it to get the flag.
