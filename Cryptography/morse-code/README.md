## Description
Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this? Download the file [here](./morse_chal.wav).  
Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.
## Hints
1. Audacity is a really good program to analyze morse code audio.
## Approach
We can do this question without Audacity or understanding Morse code by uploading the file into [morsecodeworld](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) and letting that decode it for you. The result is "WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7"
